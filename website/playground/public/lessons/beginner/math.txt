# Math

Let's get started by writing a simple calculator!

2 + 2

...wait, nothing happened. Why not?

## Computers do exactly what you tell them to do

The problem is that you told the computer to add 2 and 2 together, but you didn't tell it what to do with the result! So the answer (`4`) is just discarded. Remember that computers always do exactly what you tell them to do, and never anything you don't. To fix this, we can add `show` to the front of our calculation, which instructs the computer to display it on the screen:

---
id: IBq2LaS2
type: code
---

show (2 + 2)

---
id: iZ4fDq4P
type: text
locked: true

Hooray, now `4` appears on the screen! Try changing the numbers and experiment with other symbols, and see what happens.

### Some more examples

You can write code over multiple lines, and Wipple will run them one by one:

---
id: T4Upgyqp
type: code
---

show 1
show (1 + 1)
show (1 - 1)
show (2 * 3)
show (3 / 4)
show (0.1 + 0.2)
show (1 / 0)

### More complex calculations

You can use Wipple as a full calculator by grouping calculations with parentheses. Try it out!

---
id: nEIfqWuz
type: code
---

show (2 + 2 + 2)
show (1 - (2 + 3))
show ((3 + 2) / 10)
show ((2 + 2) * (2 + 3 * 2))
