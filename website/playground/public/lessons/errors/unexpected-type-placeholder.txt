# How to fix the "type placeholder is not allowed here" error

Type placeholders are denoted with `_` and indicate that the type should be inferred. Wipple doesn't allow you to infer the types of fields or variants in a `type` definition:

---
id: ceH5TAP1
type: code
---

Wrapper : type { value :: _ }

---
id: 6TIYQSuR
type: text
locked: true
---

Instead, provide a type parameter using a type function:

---
id: SL450Kz3
type: code
---

Wrapper : Value => type { value :: Value }
