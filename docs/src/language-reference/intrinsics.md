# Intrinsics

Wipple uses intrinsics to give the compiler special knowledge of certain types, traits and constants. For example, whenever the `+` operator is used, Wipple calls the function defined by the `add` intrinsic â€” in the standard library, this is the `Add` trait.

To define an intrinsic, use the `intrinsic` keyword, followed by the type of value (`type`, `trait`, or `constant`) and its name:

```wipple
intrinsic "trait" "add" : Add
```

The compiler assumes that the associated type, trait, or constant has the correct shape and behavior; if it doesn't, the compiler may produce invalid code, strange type errors, or crash.

Here's a list of the intrinsics used in Wipple:
