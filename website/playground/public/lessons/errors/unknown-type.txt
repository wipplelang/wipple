# How to fix the "could not determine the type of this expression" error

In Wipple, every value must have a type. Usually, this type is inferred automatically, but sometimes there isn't enough context to determine what it should be. Usually, this happens with functions like `collect`:

---
id: DCKum3gL
type: code
---

numbers : 0 to 10 by 1 . collect
numbers . each show

---
id: h2LQbfLa
type: text
locked: true
---

In the above example, Wipple can't determine which type to collect into (ie. a type for which the `From-Sequence` trait is implemented). You can provide a manual type annotation using the `::` operator:

---
id: OIqhFkIL
type: code
---

numbers : 0 to 10 by 1 . collect :: List Number
numbers . each show

---
id: dRykr0Wz
type: text
locked: true
---

You don't need to provide the entire type to `::` — usually Wipple can infer the rest. Here, Wipple knows that if you're collecting into a list, the element type must be `Number` because that's the type of the value the sequence produces:

---
id: xVRFQwIZ
type: code
---

numbers : 0 to 10 by 1 . collect :: List _
numbers . each show
