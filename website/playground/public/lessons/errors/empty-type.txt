# How to fix the "type must contain at least one field or variant" error

This error is caused by a type that has no fields or variants. In Wipple, a structure or enumeration type must contain at least one field or variant:

---
id: Jwj0Nyjd
type: code
---

My-Type : type {}

---
id: PHqXn6no
type: text
locked: true
---

To fix the error, either add a field or variant, or remove the `{}` to create a marker type:

---
id: Q2gbrp8s
type: code
---

My-Type : type
