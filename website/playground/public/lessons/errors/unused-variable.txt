# How to fix the "unused variable" warning

This warning occurs when you declare a variable but never use it anywhere:

---
id: I20Fqrep
type: code
---

add : a b -> a + a
show (add 1 2)

---
id: kfXbb5An
type: text
locked: true
---

In the example above, there's a bug — `a` is added to itself instead of to `b`. Because `b` is never used, Wipple produces a warning. To fix the warning, either use the variable somewhere or replace it with `_`:

---
id: zU2pOvzA
type: code
---

-- If you meant to add the two numbers...
add : a b -> a + b
show (add 1 2)

---
id: UwE8pMFE
type: code
---

-- If you meant to ignore the second number...
add : a _ -> a + a
show (add 1 2)
