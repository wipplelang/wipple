## Traits

Earlier, we figured out that the type of `show` is `Text -> ()` — that is, it accepts text and returns nothing. Well, that's a lie! `show` also accepts numbers and anything else that's "showable". So how does `show` work? Let's try a revised type:

```wipple
show :: A => A -> ()
```

Hmm, that's a bit _too_ general. `A` can be any type, but not everything is "showable" — `Person` and `Pair` values certainly aren't. (Try running `show bob` to see!)

To figure out the true type of `show`, we need one more piece of the puzzle: **traits**. Traits allow us to describe the behavior of a _type_ in the same way functions describe the behavior of a value. The true type of `show` is as follows:

```wipple
show :: A where (Show A) => A -> ()
```

The `where` clause means "Any `A` as long as `A` is `Show`-able". What's `Show`? That's our trait!

```wipple
Show : A => trait (A -> Text)
```

This piece of code means "for any type `A`, to `Show` an `A` means to implement a function that, given a value of type `A`, produces a `Text`". Phew!

So how exactly do we "implement a function"? We need to learn one more command: `instance`.

```wipple
instance Show Person : { name age } -> format "_, age _" name age
```

Now Wipple knows that to `Show` a `Person` means to use the function we provided! Check it out:

```wipple
show bob -- Bob, age 30
```

Pretty neat! Traits and instances allow us to define **new functionality** for **existing code**, even code we didn't write!

And to combine all of our knowledge so far, here's a line taken straight out of the builtin Wipple functions:

```wipple
instance Show Text : it
```

If you understand what's going on there, great job! If you don't quite yet, don't worry — you'll figure it out as you keep coding.

Now let's move on to something different!
