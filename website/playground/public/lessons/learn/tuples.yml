      # Tuples

      Tuples are another way to group values together. They're similar to structures, but don't have a name associated with each item. Tuples can come in handy when you want to return more than one value from a function without needing to create a whole new type.

      You can create a tuple using the `,` operator:
    locked: true
  - id: MKlTolYW
    type: code
    value: 'my-tuple : 1 , "hello"'
    lint: false
  - id: o3pJ2ncA
    type: text
    value: 'And you can retrieve the values inside the tuple using `,` as well:'
    locked: true
  - id: lkruPPuP
    type: code
    value: |-
      my-tuple : 1 , "hello"

      number , text : my-tuple

      show number
      show text
  - id: w71SAhqs
    type: text
    value: 'A good example of tuples in action is to represent a point in space:'
    locked: true
  - id: pvtHgnie
    type: code
    value: |-
      origin : 0 , 0

      translate : dx , dy -> x , y -> (x + dx) , (y + dy)

      up : dy -> translate (0 , dy)

      x , y : up 3 origin
      show (format "x: _ y: _" x y)

    value: Try changing the example to support 3-dimensional points!
