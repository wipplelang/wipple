      # Customizing the Playground

      Now that you're familiar with Wipple and the Wipple Playground, it's a good time to show you how to customize your program's output with font sizes, formatting, and images!

      The Wipple Playground displays your program's output in a format called [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org). Let's try it out!

      To make your text **bold** or *italic*, surround it with asterisks:
