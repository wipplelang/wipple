# Numeric types

So far, we've only used the `Number` type to represent numbers. But Wipple has several other numeric types as well! The most commonly used numeric type other than `Number` is `Natural`, which can hold the natural numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, ...).

For example, `times` accepts a `Natural` instead of a `Number`, since it only makes sense to repeat something a whole number of times:

---
id: yK0bP5Kx
type: code
---

repeat (0.5 times) { ... }

---
id: dszQbf2f
type: text
locked: true
---

Hover over the error and you'll see that Wipple prevents us from passing a fractional number to `times`!

If you need to convert between numeric types, you can use `as` and `as?`:

---
id: TPxAx-ay
type: code
---

number :: Number
number : 0.5

natural :: Natural
natural : 3

show (natural as Number)
show (number as? Natural)
