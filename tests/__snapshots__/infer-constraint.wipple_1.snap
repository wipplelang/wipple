Feedback:

`_` (infer-constraint.wipple:5:39) (placeholder):

  Found a placeholder of type `Number Number -> Number`.
  
  Add a `Number Number -> Number` value here before running your program.

`_` (infer-constraint.wipple:6:39) (placeholder):

  Found a placeholder of type `String String -> String`.
  
  Add a `String String -> String` value here before running your program.

`_` (infer-constraint.wipple:9:7) (placeholder):

  Found a placeholder of type `left right -> sum`.
  
  Add a `left right -> sum` value here before running your program.

`add` (infer-constraint.wipple:11:6) (unresolved-bound):

  `add` (infer-constraint.wipple:11:6) requires the instance `Add Number Number String`, but this
  instance isn't defined.
  
  Double-check that these types are correct.

`_` (infer-constraint.wipple:14:45) (placeholder):

  Found a placeholder of type `Number Number -> Number`.
  
  Add a `Number Number -> Number` value here before running your program.

`_` (infer-constraint.wipple:15:45) (placeholder):

  Found a placeholder of type `String String -> String`.
  
  Add a `String String -> String` value here before running your program.

`_` (infer-constraint.wipple:18:13) (placeholder):

  Found a placeholder of type `left right -> sum`.
  
  Add a `left right -> sum` value here before running your program.

`output` (infer-constraint.wipple:20:1) (conflicting-types):

  `output` (infer-constraint.wipple:20:1) is a `Number` or a `String`, but it can only be one of
  these.
  
  `output` (infer-constraint.wipple:20:1) must be the same type as `add-infer 1 2` (infer-
  constraint.wipple:20:10), `add-infer 1 2` (infer-constraint.wipple:20:11), and `String` (infer-
  constraint.wipple:20:28); double-check these.
  
    -  Annotated as `String` here.
