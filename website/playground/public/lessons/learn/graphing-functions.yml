      # Graphing functions

      Next, we'll learn how to plot mathematical functions on a graph! The syntax is very similar to turtle graphics — let's start by `use`-ing the `graphing` file:
    locked: true
  - id: OnKm7Rv9
    type: code
    value: use "graphing.wpl"
  - id: fMuka6iQ
    type: text
    value: '`graphing.wpl` gives us access to `with-graph`, which we can use just like `with-turtle`. Let''s plot a simple example!'
    locked: true
  - id: ru4E_6hT
    type: code
    value: |-
      use "graphing.wpl"

      with-graph (graph -> {
      	graph . plot (x -> x ^ 3)
      })
  - id: 9bhXSLxB
    type: text
    value: By default, the graph looks like the above. But we can change the bounds as well as the color!
    locked: true
  - id: VpC7Khuj
    type: code
    value: |-
      use "graphing.wpl"

      with-graph (graph -> {
        graph . min-y 0
        graph . max-y 100
        graph . color "blue"
        graph . plot (x -> x ^ 2)
      })
  - id: veRXP0zH
    type: text
    value: 'You can also graph multiple functions at the same time, each with its own color:'
    locked: true
  - id: 1wPIaNUA
    type: code
    value: |-
      use "graphing.wpl"

      with-graph (graph -> {
      	graph . color "red"
      	graph . plot (x -> x)

      	graph . color "green"
      	graph . plot (x -> x ^ 2)

      	graph . color "blue"
      	graph . plot (x -> x ^ 3)
      })
  - id: DCISESLf
    type: text
    value: Of course, we aren't limited to simple functions. We have the full power of Wipple at our disposal!
    locked: true

      use "graphing.wpl"

      f : n -> when (floor n mod 4) {
      	0 -> n * -2
      	1 -> n * -1
      	2 -> n * 1
      	3 -> n * 2
      	_ -> 0
      }

      with-graph (graph -> {
      	graph . min-x 0
      	graph . max-x 50
      	graph . min-y -100
      	graph . max-y 100
      	graph . plot f
      })
