# How to fix the "cannot find name" error

This error occurs when you refer to a name that hasn't been defined:

---
id: lP_J5bDB
type: code
---

show x

---
id: 1TOZiq_W
type: text
locked: true
---

To fix this error, define the variable using the `:` operator:

---
id: ZVCIgZ0Y
type: code
---

x : "Hello, world!"
show x

---
id: ndoe2Yxu
type: text
locked: true
---

If you're trying to display something on the screen, wrap the name in quotation marks:

---
id: SGNPlHRk
type: code
---

show "x"
