# How to fix the "cannot instantiate built-in type" error

This error occurs when you attempt to construct a built-in type like `Text` or `Number`.

---
id: zOzHsSGw
type: code
---

my-text : Text { contents : ... }
show my-text

---
id: LSu8Ojqq
type: text
locked: true
---

Instead, use a literal:

---
id: b-ofS0Z1
type: code
---

my-text : "Hello"
show my-text
