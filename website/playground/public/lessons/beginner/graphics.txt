# Graphics

Let's learn some more Wipple commands by drawing some graphics!

All of Wipple's graphics functionality is behind `turtle`. We can write `use "turtle"` at the top of our code to tell the computer that we'd like to use turtle graphics:

---
id: 8uH-M6ww
type: code
---

use "turtle"

---
id: PywAcOaX
type: text
locked: true
---

And then we can create a turtle with the `with-turtle` command:

---
id: tVT53pcn
type: code
---

use "turtle"

with-turtle {
    -- More to follow...
}

---
id: v9th9bx8

locked: true
---

Great! The `with-turtle` command accepts a "block" of code, which begins with `{` and ends with `}`. A **block** is a way to group multiple commands into one. The thing to remember is that all of your drawing commands must go inside the block.

---

type: code
---

use "turtle"

with-turtle {
    forward (50 pixels)
}

---

As you can see, the `forward` command lets us move the turtle forward by a number of `pixels`. We also have the `backward`, `left` and `right` commands to control the turtle's movement. Let's draw a square!

type: code
---

use "turtle"

with-turtle {
    forward (50 pixels)
    left (90 degrees)
    forward (50 pixels)
    left (90 degrees)
    forward (50 pixels)
    left (90 degrees)
    forward (50 pixels)
    left (90 degrees)
}

Here are a few more commands — they should be pretty self-explanatory:

---
id: rS44ihW_
type: code
---

use "turtle"

with-turtle {
    width (500 pixels)
    right (90 degrees)
    color `red`
    forward (50 pixels)
    color `green`
    forward (50 pixels)
    color `blue`
    forward (50 pixels)
}

You can change the colors by clicking on them. If you want to add a new color, click the `+` button in the top right and select the color symbol.
