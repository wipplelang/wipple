# How to fix the "number does not fit" error

This error occurs when you provide a number literal that isn't representable by the number type. For example, `times` accepts a `Natural`, which can only represent whole, positive numbers:

---
id: SysmRG6i
type: code
---

times show 3.5 -- doesn't make sense to repeat something 3.5 times

---
id: NGhEiqwW
type: text
locked: true
---

To fix the error, remove the fractional part and/or negative sign from the literal:

---
id: BlHtweYk
type: code
---

times show 3
