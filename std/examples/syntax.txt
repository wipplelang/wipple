# How to use `syntax`

`syntax` lets you define your own syntax, also known as macros, in Wipple. Syntax definitions are made up of individual syntax rules that accept placeholders:

---
id: xzetelSg
type: code
---

add : syntax {
    add 'a 'b -> 'a + 'b
}

show (add 1 2)

---
id: mPH_skaP
type: text
locked: true
---

Syntax rules may accept a variable number of inputs using `...`:

---
id: 8vkDpns2
type: code
---

add : syntax {
    add ...x -> 0 ...(+ 'x)
}

show (add)
show (add 1)
show (add 1 2)
show (add 1 2 3)

---
id: 8_0eoPFZ
type: text
locked: true
---

The syntax definition's name does not need to be the first expression in the syntax rule — it can be placed anywhere:

---
id: QAA9QrKR
type: code
---

add : syntax {
    please add 'a 'b -> 'a + 'b
}

added : syntax {
   'a 'b added -> 'a + 'b
}

show (please add 1 2)
show (1 2 added)

To use a syntax definition as an operator (allowing it to be used multiple times in the same expression), use the `[operator]` attribute:

---
id: 2qfhAxSB
type: code
---

[operator Addition-Precedence]
plus : syntax {
  ('a plus 'b) -> 'a + 'b
}

show (1 plus 2 plus 3)
