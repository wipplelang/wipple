# Logic and decision making

Up until now, we've written pretty simple programs that always produce the same output. Now, we'll introduce a way for your code to make decisions about its input!

Let's say you wanted to write a program to grant or deny access based on a password. To do this, we need two things:

-   A way to compare two passwords
-   A way to display `access granted` or `access denied` depending on whether the passwords are the same or not

The first thing — comparison — is done by the `=` and `/=` signs in Wipple. Try it out below!

---
id: 02LsZUH-
type: code
---

show (1 = 1)
show (2 + 2 = 4)
show (5 /= 6)
show ("abc" = "def")

---
id: KChNmsqx
type: text
locked: true
---

By the way, `True` is what's called a **Boolean value** (which can either be `True` or `False`).

The second thing — making a decision — is done by the `if` function. Just provide a Boolean value and two other values. If the Boolean value is `True`, the first value will be returned, and if it's `False`, the second will be returned.

Now we can write our password checker!

---
id: -F0vsrvh
type: code
---

password : "abc123"
check : input -> if (input = password) "access granted" "access denied"

show (check "letmein")
show (check "password")
show (check "abc123")

---
id: 45dG8R6m
type: text
locked: true
---

(Please don't actually implement a password checker like this! Real password checkers use a much more complicated system to ensure security.)

Here are some other logic symbols you can use:

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Symbol</b></td>
            <td><b>Function</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>a = b</code></td>
            <td>Is <code>a</code> equal to <code>b</code>?</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>a /= b</code></td>
            <td>Is <code>a</code> not equal to <code>b</code>?</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>a < b</code></td>
            <td>Is <code>a</code> less than <code>b</code>?</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>a > b</code></td>
            <td>Is <code>a</code> greater than <code>b</code>?</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>a <= b</code></td>
            <td>Is <code>a</code> less than or equal to <code>b</code>?</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>a >= b</code></td>
            <td>Is <code>a</code> greater than or equal to <code>b</code>?</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>a and b</code></td>
            <td>Are both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> <code>True</code>?</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>a or b</code></td>
            <td>Is either <code>a</code> or <code>b</code> <code>True</code>?</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
