# How to fix the "when expression not handle all possible values" error

This error occurs inside a `when` expression whose patterns don't cover all possible values:

---
id: BFp0kCV-
type: code
---

Grade : type { A B C D F }

grade : A

report-card : when grade {
    A -> "top of the class"
    B -> "good job"
    C -> "need to study"
}

show report-card

In the example above, the provided `grade` could potentially be `D` or `F`, and these cases are not handled. To fix the error, add the other cases:

---
id: msDMhWav
type: code
---

Grade : type { A B C D F }

grade : A

report-card : when grade {
    A -> "top of the class"
    B -> "good job"
    C -> "need to study"
    D or F -> "didn't pass"
}

show report-card

If you know that the other patterns will never be reached, you can crash the program:

---
id: K_-ZWXZD
type: code
---

Grade : type { A B C D F }

grade : A

report-card : when grade {
    A -> "top of the class"
    B -> "good job"
    C -> "need to study"
    D or F -> error "failure is not an option!"
}

show report-card
