# How to fix the "cannot use this trait as a value" error

This error occurs when you use a type-level trait as a value. These traits may only be used in bounds:

---
id: FPgO8zMJ
type: code
---

Implemented : A => trait

instance (Implemented Number)
instance (Implemented Text)

show Implemented

---
id: WMM85_1J
type: text
locked: true
---

To fix the error, either remove the use of the trait in value position or give the trait a value (eg. `()`):

---
id: hDua1TCO
type: code
lint: false
---

Implemented : A => trait

instance (Implemented Number)
instance (Implemented Text)

assert-implemented :: A where (Implemented A) => A -> A
assert-implemented : it

assert-implemented 42
assert-implemented "hi"
