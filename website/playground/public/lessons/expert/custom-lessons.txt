# Creating your own Playground lessons

Congratulations, you've made it to the end of Learn Wipple! ðŸ¤© Now, you can use the Wipple Playground to create your own lessons on anything you want.

If you click on the six dots on the left-hand side of a code box, you can create a new code box or add some text. Depending on which one you choose, you get different options. For code boxes, you can disable lints for a particular code example if you're trying to explain something and don't want the warnings to get in the way. Text boxes are rendered as [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org), and when you're done editing, make sure to lock the text box so people don't accidentally expose the Markdown while they're trying to read.

To share your lesson, just copy the URL in the address bar, or click Copy Link in the menu next to the beginner mode toggle at the bottom of the screen.

Thank you for taking the time to learn Wipple! If you have any feedback, there's a Feedback link in the top right. Good luck on your programming journey!
