error: expected code after this `:`
---

Wipple displays this error when you're missing a value for a variable declared with a colon (`:`).

For example, this code causes the error:

```wipple
my-number :
```

### How can I fix it?

Try writing a piece of code after the `:` to give your variable a value:

```wipple
my-number : 3.14
```
