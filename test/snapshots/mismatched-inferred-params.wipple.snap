Feedback:

`transform` (test/tests/mismatched-inferred-params.wipple:3:13-3:22) (error-instance):

  Can't make a sequence from   `1, 2, 3` (test/tests/mismatched-inferred-params.wipple:3:2-3:9).

 You can't use   `1, 2, 3` (test/tests/mismatched-inferred-params.wipple:3:2-3:9) as a sequence. Try using a list instead.
