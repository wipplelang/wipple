Feedback:

`_` (sequence.wipple:18:44) (placeholder):

  Found a placeholder of type `(Box value) -> Sequence value`.
  
  Add a `(Box value) -> Sequence value` value here before running your program.

`_` (sequence.wipple:21:10) (placeholder):

  Found a placeholder of type `(item -> Boolean) -> collection -> Sequence item`.
  
  Add a `(item -> Boolean) -> collection -> Sequence item` value here before running your program.

`_` (sequence.wipple:23:8) (placeholder):

  Found a placeholder of type `Box String`.
  
  Add a `Box String` value here before running your program.

`_` (sequence.wipple:24:14) (conflicting-types):

  `_` (sequence.wipple:24:14) is `String` or `Number`, but it can only be one of these.
  
  `_` (sequence.wipple:24:14) must be the same type as `Number` (sequence.wipple:24:19), `_`
  (sequence.wipple:24:13), and `String` (sequence.wipple:23:17); double-check these.

`_` (sequence.wipple:24:30) (placeholder):

  Found a placeholder of type `Boolean`.
  
  Add a `Boolean` value here before running your program.
