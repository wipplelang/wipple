Up until now, we've written pretty simple programs that always produce the same output. Now, we'll introduce a way for your code to make decisions about its input!

Let's say you wanted to write a program to grant or deny access based on a password. To do this, we need three things:

-   A way to ask the user for a password
-   A way to compare the provided password with the correct one
-   A way to display `access granted` or `access denied` depending on whether the passwords are the same or not

The first thing â€”Â asking the user for a password â€”Â is done with the `prompt` command:

---
id: 4Mt8YkZk
type: code
---

password : prompt "Enter a password (not your actual password, please!)"
message : "You entered _" password
show message

---
id: Y2UuYUud
type: text
locked: true
---

And you can check if two variables contain the same value using the equal sign (`=`):

---
id: 02LsZUH-
type: code
---

password : prompt "Enter a password"
correct-password : "123"
show (password = correct-password)

---
id: KChNmsqx
type: text
locked: true
---

Depending on what you type in, the program will show "True" or "False", where `True` means the passwords are the same, and `False` means they are different.

Now we can make a decision on what to display using the `if` command! `if` accepts a condition and two other values. If the condition is `True`, the first value will be produced, and if the condition is `False`, the second value will be produced.

Let's put it all together!

---
id: -F0vsrvh
type: code
---

password : prompt "Enter a password"
correct-password : "123"
message : if (password = correct-password) "Access granted!" "Access denied!"
show message

---
id: I-BwiLtf
type: text
locked: true
---

If you're feeling pretty confident with all of this, try extending the example to ask the user for their name and greet them if they enter the correct password. (Hint: you'll need to use another variable, along with `prompt` and placeholder text).

id: xsY8WcP5
type: code
---

---
id: 45dG8R6m
type: text
locked: true

In addition to `=`, here are some other logic symbols you can use:

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Symbol</b></td>
            <td><b>Function</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>a = b</code></td>
            <td>Is <code>a</code> equal to <code>b</code>?</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>a /= b</code></td>
            <td>Is <code>a</code> not equal to <code>b</code>?</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>a < b</code></td>
            <td>Is <code>a</code> less than <code>b</code>?</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>a > b</code></td>
            <td>Is <code>a</code> greater than <code>b</code>?</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>a <= b</code></td>
            <td>Is <code>a</code> less than or equal to <code>b</code>?</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>a >= b</code></td>
            <td>Is <code>a</code> greater than or equal to <code>b</code>?</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>a and b</code></td>
            <td>Are both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> <code>True</code>?</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>a or b</code></td>
            <td>Is either <code>a</code> or <code>b</code> <code>True</code>?</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
