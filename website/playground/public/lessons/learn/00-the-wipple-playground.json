This interactive guide is meant for people who have never written code before — if you're already experienced in other languages, please read [the quick start guides](#) instead.\n\nThe Wipple Playground provides a simple, easy-to-use environment for writing Wipple code. Just type into the code editor and your code will run instantly, displaying its output below. The playground also automatically detects errors in your code and highlights them in red, just like a word processor!\n\nThroughout this guide, any time you see text in `this font`, it represents code. Any outlined code section (like the one below) can be edited directly, so feel free to play around with it — you'll learn more by experimenting!",
