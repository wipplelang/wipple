      # Variables

      You're probably familiar with variables in math — a variable is just a way to give some complex calculation a name. It's the same thing in Wipple! Let's try it out:
    locked: true
  - id: tFK_rYbm
    type: code
    value: |-
      x : 2 + 2
      show x
  - id: ERs9C21t
    type: text
    value: |-
      Instead of using an `=` sign, Wipple uses `:` (a colon). You can pronounce `a : b` as _"a is b"_. Now, anywhere the computer sees `x`, it will replace it with `4`!

      Let's try a more complicated example:
    locked: true
  - id: S1YVzvVY
    type: code
    value: |-
      a : 3
      b : a + 2
      c : a + b
      show c
  - id: n_Cjtvm7
    type: text
    value: 'Note that unlike in math, you can use words for variables in Wipple. Like this:'
    locked: true
  - id: wSFfEy1-
    type: code
    value: |-
      sum : 2 + 2
      show sum

      my-awesome-variable : 3 + 4
      show my-awesome-variable
  - id: ljf-TwG-
    type: text
    value: |-
      Try making some variables of your own in the playground!

      Can you guess what this code does?
    locked: true
  - id: pdVmbWo1
    type: code
    value: show hmmm
  - id: JJyEzG8W
    type: text
    value: Error! Try to figure out what the problem is and how to fix it — what did you have to do?
