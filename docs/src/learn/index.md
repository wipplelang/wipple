# Let's write some Wipple code!

> This guide assumes you know a bit of programming in some other language. A guide for complete beginners is planned!

You don't even need to install anything. The full language is available right from your web browser at [playground.wipple.gramer.dev](https://playground.wipple.gramer.dev).

The Wipple Playground is split into two sections — on the left is your code, and on the right is your code's output.

As always, the first program we'll write is Hello World:

```wipple
show "Hello, world!"
```

You should see `Hello, world!` on the right!

> **Tip:** To give yourself more room for your code, you can resize the panels so the output takes up less space.

> How is the playground so fast? Instead of sending your code to be executed on a server, the Wipple interpreter is actually compiled into [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org) and run directly in your browser!

As you continue this guide, keep the playground open so you can try any code examples listed. Experiment by changing the code a bit and see what happens!
