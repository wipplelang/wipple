# How to fix the "redundant case in `when` expression" warning

This warning occurs when you have a pattern in a `when` expression that is already matched by a previous pattern, so the code on the right-hand side will never be executed:

---
id: eI_zscCL
type: code
---

when (Some 42) {
  Some x -> show x
  Some y -> show (y + 1)
  None -> show "none"
}

To fix this warning, remove the redundant case or adjust it so that it matches a unique set of values:

---
id: DLwsvsRP
type: code
---

when (Some 42) {
  Some 42 -> show "forty-two"
  Some y -> show (y + 1)
  None -> show "none"
}
