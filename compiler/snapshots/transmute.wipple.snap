Feedback:

`x` (compiler/tests/transmute.wipple:4:13-4:14) (conflicting-types):

  `x` (compiler/tests/transmute.wipple:4:13-4:14) is a `a` (compiler/tests/transmute.wipple:3:14-3:15) or a `b` (compiler/tests/transmute.wipple:3:19-3:20), but it can only be one of these.

  `x` (compiler/tests/transmute.wipple:4:13-4:14) must be the same type as `x` (compiler/tests/transmute.wipple:4:18-4:19), `a` (compiler/tests/transmute.wipple:3:14-3:15), and `b` (compiler/tests/transmute.wipple:3:19-3:20); double-check these.
