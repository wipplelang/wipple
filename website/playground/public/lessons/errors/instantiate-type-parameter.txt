# How to fix the "cannot instantiate type parameter" error

This error occurs when you attempt to instantiate a type parameter as if it were a structure or enumeration type. Because a type parameter can represent one of potentially many types, a value with this type cannot be constructed directly.

construct :: A => () -> A
construct : () -> A { field : "A" }

To fix this error, you can add a bound that requires the type parameter's type to implement a certain trait, which you can delegate to in order to construct the value:

Construct : A => trait (() -> A)

construct :: A where (Construct A) => () -> A
construct : Construct
