Feedback:

`"42"` (test/tests/constant-mismatched-types.wipple:4:5-4:9) (conflicting-types):

  `"42"` (test/tests/constant-mismatched-types.wipple:4:5-4:9) is a `Number` (test/tests/constant-mismatched-types.wipple:3:6-3:12) or a `String` (test/tests/constant-mismatched-types.wipple:4:5-4:9), but it can only be one of these.

  `"42"` (test/tests/constant-mismatched-types.wipple:4:5-4:9) must be the same type as `Number` (test/tests/constant-mismatched-types.wipple:3:6-3:12) and `x :: Number` (test/tests/constant-mismatched-types.wipple:1:1-3:12); double-check these.

  -  `"42"` (test/tests/constant-mismatched-types.wipple:4:5-4:9) is a String.
