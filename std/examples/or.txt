# How to use `or`

`or` is used in two places in Wipple: first, to compare two Boolean values just like in most other languages:

---
id: nw20fqGc
type: code
---

show (True or True)
show (True or False)
show (False or True)
show (False or False)

---
id: 74lOnTBm
type: text
locked: true
---

`or` "short-circuits" — if the left-hand side is `True`, the right-hand side is never evaluated:

---
id: tfh5aHJF
type: code
---

True or error "unreachable"

---
id: xc63RSe-
type: text
locked: true
---

The second use of `or` is to match multiple patterns at once inside a `when` expression:

---
id: CNNG4IQx
type: code
---

validate :: Maybe Number -> Text
validate : n -> when n {
  Some (1 or 2 or 3) or None -> "valid"
  _ -> "invalid"
}

show (validate (Some 1))
show (validate None)
show (validate (Some 5))
