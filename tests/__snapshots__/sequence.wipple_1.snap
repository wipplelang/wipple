Feedback:

`_` (sequence.wipple:24:14) (conflicting-types):

  `_` (sequence.wipple:24:14) is a `String` (sequence.wipple:24:14) or a `Number`
  (sequence.wipple:24:14), but it can only be one of these.
  
    -  See `As-Sequence : collection (infer element) => trait (collection -> Sequence element)`
  (sequence.wipple:17:1).
  
    -  See `Box : value => type {
      value :: value
  }` (sequence.wipple:13:1).
  
    -  See `filter :: (item -> Boolean) -> collection -> Sequence item where (As-Sequence collection
  item)` (sequence.wipple:20:1).
  
    -  `filter` (sequence.wipple:25:2) requires `As-Sequence (Box String) String`.
  
    -  `String` (sequence.wipple:23:17) explicitly requires a `String` (sequence.wipple:23:17).
  
    -  `Number` (sequence.wipple:24:19) explicitly requires a `Number` (sequence.wipple:24:19).
  
    -  `element` (sequence.wipple:10:14) must have the same type everywhere in this use of `Sequence
  : element => type {⋯}` (sequence.wipple:9:1).
