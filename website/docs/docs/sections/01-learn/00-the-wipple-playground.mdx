Welcome! Wipple is a programming language that's designed to be natural to read, write and learn. This guide is meant for people who have never written code before — if you're already experienced in other languages, please read [the quick start guides](/02-quick-start/00-for-javascript-developers) instead.

### The Wipple Playground

It's easy to get started with Wipple, no installation required. In fact, all you need is a web browser! Just visit the [Wipple Playground](https://playground.wipple.gramer.dev) and you have everything you need to run Wipple code. We'll be using the playground frequently in this guide, so you can learn by doing.

The Wipple Playground provides a simple, easy-to-use environment for writing Wipple code. Just type into the code editor and your code will run instantly, showing its results inline. The playground also automatically detects errors in your code and highlights them with a red squiggle, just like a word processor!

Throughout this guide, any time you see text in `this font`, it represents code. You can copy and paste the code into the playground to run it, or just click **Run in Playground** to launch a new editor with the example already typed in for you. Try it now — click **Run in Playground** below!

```wipple
show "Hello, world!"
```

You should see `Hello, world!` appear on the screen.
