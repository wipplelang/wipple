# How to use `with`

`with` is used to set the value of a contextual constant while a block of code executes. It's used to pass down dependencies implicitly, rather than having to specify an extra parameter on all of your functions:

---
id: buAKqPZd
type: code
---

[context]
excited :: Boolean
excited : False -- the constant's default value

greet :: Text -> ()
greet : name -> {
  greeting : if excited (format "Hi _!!!" name) (format "Hello, _" name)
  show greeting
}

greet "Alice"

with (excited : True) {
  greet "Bob"
}
