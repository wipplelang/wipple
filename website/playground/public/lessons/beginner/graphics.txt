The turtle moves around based on your commands. The `forward` command lets us move the turtle forward by a number of `pixels`:

---
id: 6rHumtfp
type: code
setup: turtle
---

forward (50 pixels)

---

---

We also have the `backward`, `left` and `right` commands to control the turtle's movement. Let's draw a square!

---
id: Vn7dOoiZ
type: code
setup: turtle
---

forward (50 pixels)
left (90 degrees)
forward (50 pixels)
left (90 degrees)
forward (50 pixels)
left (90 degrees)
forward (50 pixels)
left (90 degrees)

Hmm, notice how we repeat the same two lines of code multiple times? There's a better way to do this, with the `repeat` command!

---
id: 7gSd_8oy
type: code
setup: turtle
---

repeat (4 times) {
  forward (50 pixels)
  left (90 degrees)
}

The `repeat` command accepts a number of `times`, and repeats the provided code that number of times. Don't forget to put the code between curly braces (`{` and `}`)! This tells the computer to only repeat the commands between the braces.

Here are a few more commands:

-  `icon` lets you change the turtle to whatever you want â€”Â click on the image box to select an icon!
-  `width` and `height` let you change the size of the canvas.
-  `color` lets you change the color of the line being drawn â€”Â click on the color to change it!
