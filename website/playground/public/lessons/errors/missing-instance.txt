# How to fix the "could not find instance" error

This error occurs when Wipple couldn't find an instance of a trait that is usable in the surrounding context. For example, when you try to `show` something that can't be shown, you get this error:

---
id: t52tNHIc
type: code
---

Person : type { name :: Text }

bob : Person { name : "Bob" }
show bob

---
id: eWTucHWY
type: text
locked: true
---

To fix this error, double check that you are providing values of the correct types, or add an `instance` for the type in question:

---
id: tswQJkFl
type: code
---

Person : type { name :: Text }
instance (Show Person) : { name } -> name

bob : Person { name : "Bob" }
show bob
