The new Wipple Playground is the result of student feedback and features a huge list of improvements. And it's powered by a new Wipple compiler that's built for speed. Here are some of the most notable changes...

### Save your projects with cloud sync

The new Wipple Playground saves your work in the cloud, so you can come back to a project later. You can even sign in with your Google account, and all of your projects will sync between devices!

### Redesigned code editor

The redesigned code editor has a fresh new look and a ton of handy features:

-   **Quick Help:** Click on the magnifying glass button, then hover your mouse over any piece of code, and Wipple will tell you what it does.
-   **Palette:** Drag colors, functions, and other objects and drop them right into your code.
-   **Inline errors:** When you make a mistake, error messages appear right next to the code that caused the error. Click on the Fix button to fix your code automatically.
-   **Insert new lines with your mouse:** Click on the top or bottom of the code editor to insert a new line.
-   **Resizable Turtle canvas:** Drag the bottom-right corner of the canvas to resize it, so you can make larger drawings.
-   **Save Turtle drawings as images:** Click the camera button to save your drawing as an image!

### Multiple pages

Now you can create multiple pages within a single playground.

### Sharing (coming soon)

Soon, you'll be able to share a link to your playground with others and let them collaborate.

### New compiler

Wipple's new compiler is substantially smaller and faster, and uses incremental compilation to reduce the amount of work it has to do for every program. Basically, instead of scanning through all the code that powers Turtle every time you change your drawing, it will only re-scan _your_ commands and reuse everything else. In fact, the Wipple standard library is now pre-compiled and distributed with the playground!

### Try it out!

You can try the new Wipple Playground today at <a target="_blank" href="https://preview.wipple.dev">preview.wipple.dev</a>. It's not finished yet, so if you run into issues, please click the Give Feedback button at the bottom of the screen. Thank you!
