# How to fix the "constant already exists" error

This error is raised when you have two constants with the same name in the same file. Because constants may be referred to in a different order than they were declared, it would be ambiguous which constant you were referring to if there were duplicates.

n :: Number
n : 1

n :: Number
n : 2

show n -- which `n`?
