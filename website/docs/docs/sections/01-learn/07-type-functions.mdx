## Type functions

Now that we've learned about types and functions, we can learn about **type functions**! A type function is similar to a regular function, except it accepts a type as input and produces another type as output. Type functions are used in combination with regular functions to make **generic values** that work with any type. The symbol for type functions is `=>`, pronounced _"becomes a"_.

To understand all this, let's create a function called `it`:

```wipple
it : x -> x
```

`it` is a very simple function — all it does is returns its input. Now let's use `it` a few times:

```wipple
show (it 42)
show (it "hello")
```

Uh-oh, we get an error! Wipple's type inference determined that `it` has the type `Number -> Number` based on its usage in `show (it 42)`. So that means we can't use `it` with `Text` at the same time! Ideally, we could have `it` accept _any value_.

To make `it` more general, we can provide a type function:

```wipple
it :: A => A -> A
it : x -> x
```

Here, `A` is a **type parameter**, and `it` has the type `A -> A`. Whenever Wipple sees a type function, it provides a type for `A` automatically using type inference:

```wipple
it 42 -- here, `A : Number`
it "hello" -- here, `A : Text`
```

Here's another example, `just`, which ignores its second input:

```wipple
just :: A B => A -> B -> A
just : x -> _ -> x
```

`it` and `just` are very handy functions to keep around. In fact, they're so handy that they're included in the Wipple Playground by default!

Now let's learn how to create our own types!
