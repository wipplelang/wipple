Feedback:

`_` (recursive-bounds.wipple:6:30) (placeholder):

  Found a placeholder of type `String -> String`.
  
  Add a `String -> String` value here before running your program.

`_` (recursive-bounds.wipple:7:60) (placeholder):

  Found a placeholder of type `(Maybe value) -> String`.
  
  Add a `(Maybe value) -> String` value here before running your program.

`_` (recursive-bounds.wipple:9:11) (placeholder):

  Found a placeholder of type `Maybe String`.
  
  Add a `Maybe String` value here before running your program.

`Describe` (recursive-bounds.wipple:10:1) (unresolved-bound):

  `Describe` (recursive-bounds.wipple:10:1) requires the instance `Describe Number`, but this
  instance isn't defined.
  
  Double-check that these types are correct.

`_` (recursive-bounds.wipple:10:11) (placeholder):

  Found a placeholder of type `Maybe Number`.
  
  Add a `Maybe Number` value here before running your program.
