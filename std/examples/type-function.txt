# How to use `=>`

The `=>` operator is used to define a type function. Just as regular functions accept a set of values and produce a new value, type functions accept a set of types and produce a new type. The result of a type function may be an existing type or a new type, trait, or instance:

Either : A B => type {
  Left A
  Right B
}

left :: A B => Either A B -> Maybe A
left : either -> when either {
  Left left -> Some left
  Right _ -> None
}

right :: A B => Either A B -> Maybe B
right : either -> when either {
  Left _ -> None
  Right right -> Some right
}

either :: Either Text Number
either : Left "Hello, world!"

show (left either)
show (right either)
