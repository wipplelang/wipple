Let's learn some more Wipple commands by drawing some graphics!

All of Wipple's graphics functionality is in a file, or **library**, named `turtle`. We can write `use "turtle"` at the top of our code to tell the computer that we'd like to access to the turtle graphics library:

---
id: 8uH-M6ww
type: code
---

use "turtle"

---
id: PywAcOaX
type: text
locked: true
---

Don't forget to write `use "turtle"` at the top of every code block!

Next, we can create a turtle using the `with-turtle` command:

---
id: tVT53pcn
type: code
---

use "turtle"

with-turtle {
  -- More to follow...
}

---
id: v9th9bx8
type: text
locked: true
---

Great! The `with-turtle` command accepts a "block" of code, which begins with `{` and ends with `}`. (These symbols are called **braces** and are located above the Return key on your keyboard.) Similar to parentheses, a **block** is a way to group multiple commands into one. The thing to remember is that all of your drawing commands must go inside the block.

use "turtle"

with-turtle {
  forward (50 pixels)
}

As you can see, the `forward` command lets us move the turtle forward by a number of `pixels`. We also have the `backward`, `left` and `right` commands to control the turtle's movement. Let's draw a square!

type: code
---

use "turtle"

with-turtle {
  forward (50 pixels)
  left (90 degrees)
  forward (50 pixels)
  left (90 degrees)
  forward (50 pixels)
  left (90 degrees)
  forward (50 pixels)
  left (90 degrees)
}

Hmm, notice how we repeat the same two lines of code multiple times? There's a better way to do this, with the `repeat` command!

---
id: jzr7pshk
type: code
---

use "turtle"

with-turtle {
  repeat (4 times) {
    forward (50 pixels)
    left (90 degrees)
  }
}

The `repeat` command accepts a number of `times`, and repeats the block of code that number of times. `repeat` is very useful, and we'll be using it a lot!

Here are a few more commands:

---
id: rS44ihW_
type: code
---

use "turtle"

with-turtle {
  icon `ðŸ˜€`
  width (500 pixels)
  right (90 degrees)

  color `red`
  forward (50 pixels)

  color `green`
  forward (50 pixels)

  color `blue`
  forward (50 pixels)
}

You can change the colors by clicking on them. If you want to add a new color, click the `+` button in the top right and select the color symbol.

Try drawing your own shapes in the space below! If you run into an error, be sure to hover your mouse over the code highlighted in red to see how to fix the problem.
