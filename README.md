Wipple is a programming language designed for learning. With Wipple, you can explore computer science through creative projects like drawing and music. Wipple is free to use and works in your web browser, no setup required.

Wipple code is natural to read and write, and the language is designed to grow with you. Under the hood, Wipple is a powerful functional programming language with an expressive type system, but when you're just getting started, these features work invisibly. When you make a mistake, Wipple provides helpful, customizable error messages that guide you toward the solution.

Wipple is developed by [Wilson Gramer](https://gramer.dev).
