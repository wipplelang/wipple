# How to use `end`

Normally, a function evaluates to the expression on the right-hand side of the arrow `->`. But if you need to interrupt the function's normal evaluation and return a value early, you can use `end`:

`end` is handy for dealing with errors:

do-something :: () -> Result Text Text
do-something : () -> Error "oh no"

show-something :: () -> Result () Text
show-something : () -> {
  n : when (do-something ()) {
    Ok n -> n
    Error e -> end (Error e)
  }

  show n

  Ok ()
}
