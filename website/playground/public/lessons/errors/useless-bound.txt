# How to fix the "this bound doesn't refer to any type parameters" warning

This warning occurs when a bound only refers to concrete types, so it will always succeed or always fail at finding a suitable instance:

---
id: Y77T-fhs
type: code
---

increment :: N where (Add Number Number Number) => N -> N
increment : ...

---
id: 2bdOG0xV
type: text
locked: true
---

To fix the warning, either remove the useless bound or change it to reference a type parameter:

---
id: AWlv19uc
type: code
---

increment :: N where (Add N N N) => N -> N
increment : ...
