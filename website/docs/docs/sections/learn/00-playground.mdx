## Learn Wipple

Welcome! Wipple is a programming language that's designed to be natural to read, write and especially learn. This guide is meant for people who have never written code before — if you're already experienced in other languages, please read [the reference](/reference) instead.

It's easy to get started with Wipple, no installation required. In fact, all you need is a web browser! Just visit the [Wipple Playground](https://playground.wipple.gramer.dev) and you have everything you need to run Wipple code. We'll be using the playground frequently in this guide, so you can learn by doing.

#### A tour of the Wipple Playground

The playground consists of a code editor into which you can type. The editor will automatically detect errors in your code and highlight them! Try pressing return a few times so your cursor is on a new line, type a random word (eg. `wipple`), and hover your mouse over the red squiggles. What happens?

By the way, any time you see text in `this font`, it represents code. You can copy and paste the code into the playground at any time to try things out on your own! Look for the <i class="fa fa-copy clip-button" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="Copy to clipboard"></i> button and click it to copy the code to your clipboard. Try it now!

```wipple
show "Hello, world!"
```

You should see `Hello, world!` in the console.
