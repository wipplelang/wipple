# How to fix the "mismatched types" error

This error is caused by code that provides a value of one type when a value of a different type is expected. For example, this function accepts `Text`, but a `Number` is provided instead:

---
id: xrqLe7PT
type: code
---

emphasize :: Text -> Text
emphasize : text -> format "_!" text

show (emphasize 3)

---
id: FWtVbGdL
type: text
locked: false
---

To fix the error, you can:

- Change the value that's provided to one of the correct type:

---
id: g8JlODWn
type: code
---

emphasize :: Text -> Text
emphasize : text -> format "_!" text

show (emphasize "3")

---
id: GSpyL26P
type: text
locked: false
---

- Use a function to convert the value into the correct type:

---
id: g-_YzHq3
type: code
---

emphasize :: Text -> Text
emphasize : text -> format "_!" text

show (emphasize (Show 3))

---
id: UTN7o9Bv
type: text
locked: false
---

- Change the function to accept the type of the provided value:

---
id: Vun2Q_YL
type: code
---

emphasize :: Number -> Text
emphasize : n -> format "_!" n

show (emphasize 3)

---
id: jQLJxoTZ
type: text
locked: false
---

- Make the function generic to accept values of any type:

---
id: N06KKekk
type: code
---

emphasize :: A where (Show A) => A -> Text
emphasize : n -> format "_!" n

show (emphasize 3)

---
id: qb1kYffc
type: text
locked: false
---

If you still can't figure out what's going wrong, try reading the [lesson on the type system](https://wipple.dev/playground/?lesson=intermediate/types).
