## Text

So far we've only worked with numbers, but Wipple supports text as well!

```wipple
show "Hello, world!"
```

Notice how `"Hello, world!"` is in a different color than `show`. This indicates that we're dealing with text instead of variables or calculations. Just keep in mind that text is always written between quotation marks! `a` means the variable `a`, while `"a"` means the letter a.

Try `show`-ing your name on the screen!
