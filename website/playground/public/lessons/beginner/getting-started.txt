Let's get started with Wipple by writing a simple calculator!

lint: false

2 + 2

---

...wait, nothing happened. Why not?

## Computers do exactly what you tell them to do

The problem is that you told the computer to add 2 and 2 together, but you didn't tell it what to do with the result! So the answer (`4`) is just discarded. Remember that computers always do exactly what you tell them to do, and never anything you don't. To fix this, we can add `show` to the front of our calculation, which instructs the computer to display it on the screen:

---
id: IBq2LaS2
type: code
---

show (2 + 2)

---
id: iZ4fDq4P
type: text
locked: true
---

Hooray, now `4` appears on the screen! Try changing the numbers and experiment with other symbols, and see what happens.

## Some more examples

You can write code over multiple lines, and Wipple will run them one by one:

---
id: T4Upgyqp
type: code
---

show 1
show (1 + 1)
show (1 - 1)
show (2 * 3)
show (3 / 4)
show (0.1 + 0.2)
show (1 / 0)

## More complex calculations

You can use Wipple as a full calculator by grouping calculations with parentheses. Try it out!

---
id: nEIfqWuz
type: code
---

show (2 + 2 + 2)
show (1 - (2 + 3))
show ((3 + 2) / 10)
show ((2 + 2) * (2 + 3 * 2))

## Why the parentheses?

Just like in math, parentheses are used to **group** symbols together. When you come across parentheses, you treat what's inside the parentheses as a single unit. Watch what happens if you don't have the parentheses:

---
id: X3wmZ8sb
type: code
---

show 1 + 2

---
id: Vv6tj1n5
type: text
locked: true
---

Hover over the error and you'll see **cannot add `show 1` to `2`**. Without the parentheses, Wipple treats `show 1` as the left-hand side of the `+`, and the `2` as the right-hand side. Wipple helpfully suggests that you wrap the `1 + 2` in parentheses — go ahead and apply the fix!

## Text

In addition to numbers, you can also display text (words) on the screen. Text always goes between quotation marks and may contain spaces — the quotes are kind of like parentheses, grouping all the words together into one string:

---
id: uj0XBll7
type: code
---

show "Hello, world!"

---
id: O5hPII46
type: text
locked: true
---

`show` is one of the most useful commands in Wipple. You usually use it to display things to the user of your program, but it's also a helpful tool for you, the programmer — when your code isn't working right, you can `show` all the numbers and other things in your program to determine the place where something's going wrong.

Next, let's learn how to draw graphics on the screen!
