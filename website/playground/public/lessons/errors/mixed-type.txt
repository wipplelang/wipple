# How to fix the "cannot mix fields and variants" error

This error occurs when you have a `type` declaration that contains both fields and variants. In Wipple, a type containing all fields is represented as a structure, and a type containing all variants is represented as an enumeration.

Report-Card : type {
  comment :: Text
  A
  B
  C
  D
  F
}

If you're trying to store some data alongside a pattern, you can write it like this:

---
id: a8tW5e29
type: code
---

Report-Card : type {
  A Text
  B Text
  C Text
  D Text
  F Text
}

---
id: aW1rwN5z
type: text
locked: true
---

If the data to be stored is the same across all fields, it's better to move the patterns into a separate type:

type: code
---

Report-Card : type {
  grade :: Grade
  comment :: Text
}

Grade : type { A B C D F }
