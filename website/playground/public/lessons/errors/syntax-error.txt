# How to fix syntax errors

Wipple code starts off as plain, unstructured text. The computer then uses a grammar to determine structure and meaning from your code. If your code doesn't follow the grammar, Wipple will issue a syntax error.

The most common syntax error is forgetting to close your parentheses and braces:

---
id: lXWyD_9A
type: code
---

show (1 + 2 -- missing ')'

---
id: 2LBLHCGj
type: text
locked: true
---

Another kind of syntax error is using the `:` operator multiple times in a single line:

---
id: 5MzyjcHM
type: code
---

x : y : 2

---
id: M3uYDgol
type: text
locked: true
---

You will also get a syntax error if you use an operator or `syntax` rule incorrectly:

---
id: FKArHNZl
type: code
---

if True -- missing the 'then' and 'else' clauses
