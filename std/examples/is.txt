# How to use `is`

The `is` operator checks if a value matches a pattern. It's useful when you just want to check a single pattern without using `when` to extract all the data:

---
id: xII7snWK
type: code
---

some-result :: Result Number Text
some-result : Error "Oh no!"

if (some-result is Error _) {
  show "Some kind of error happened"
}
