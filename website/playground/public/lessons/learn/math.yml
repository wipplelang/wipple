      # Math

      To get familiar with the Wipple Playground, let's start by writing a simple calculator!

      ...wait, nothing happened. Why not?

      ## Computers do exactly what you tell them to do

      The problem is that you told the computer to add 2 and 2 together, but you didn't tell it what to do with the result! So the answer (`4`) is just discarded. Remember that computers always do exactly what you tell them to do, and never anything you don't. To fix this, we can add `show` to the front of our calculation, which instructs the computer to display it on the screen:
    locked: true
  - id: eIJx5z-I
    type: code
    value: show (2 + 2)
  - id: qIsxU1wP
    type: text
    value: |-
      Hooray, now `4` appears on the screen! Try changing the numbers and experiment with other symbols, and see what happens.

      ### Some more examples

      What do you notice about writing code over multiple lines?

      show 1
      show (1 + 1)
      show (1 - 1)
      show (2 * 3)
      show (3 / 4)
      show (0.1 + 0.2)
      show (1 / 0)

      ### More complex calculations

      You can use Wipple as a full calculator by grouping calculations with parentheses. Try it out!

      show (2 + 2 + 2)
      show (1 - (2 + 3))

      show ((2 + 2) * (2 + 3 * 2))
