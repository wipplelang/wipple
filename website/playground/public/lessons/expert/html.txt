# Rendering HTML

`show` doesn't only print plain text. If you include HTML in your output, the Wipple Playground will automatically render it!

show "<h1 style='color: orange'>Hello, world!</h1>"

If you don't need the full power of HTML, you can use a simpler syntax called [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org). Here are the basics:

  -  `# Text` creates a header. `#` corresponds to `<h1>`, `##` corresponds to `<h2>`, etc.
  -  `**Text**` makes the text **bold** and `_Text_` makes it _italic_.
  -  `- Text` and `* Text` create a bulleted list, and `1. Text` creates a numbered list.
  -  `[Text](example.com)` creates a link.
  -  `![Alt text](example.com/image.png)` creates an image.
  -  `` `code` `` renders the text as code.
  -  `$math$` renders the text as math using $\LaTeX$.
