# How to fix naming errors

Wipple has some naming conventions to make it easier to understand what kind of value a name represents. If you define a name that doesn't follow these conventions, you will get a warning like `variable should be written in lowercase with dashes`:

---
id: DNtzghBA
type: code
---

myVariable : 42
show myVariable

---
id: XR8Oy4o8
type: text
locked: true
---

The convention in Wipple is to separate words with dashes. Variables are lowercase, while types, traits and patterns are capitalized:

---
id: 8R8F_ZQi
type: code
lint: false
---

my-variable : 42
My-Type : type { My-Pattern }
My-Trait : trait
