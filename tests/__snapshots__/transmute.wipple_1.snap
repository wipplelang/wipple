Feedback:

`x` (transmute.wipple:2:13) (conflicting-types):

  `x` (transmute.wipple:2:13) is `a` or `b`, but it can only be one of these.
  
  `x` (transmute.wipple:2:13) must be the same type as `x` (transmute.wipple:2:18), `a`
  (transmute.wipple:1:14), and `b` (transmute.wipple:1:19); double-check these.
