# Making a video game

It's time for our most challenging project yet — making a video game! Wipple has a built-in, arcade-style game engine available with `use "game"`:

---
id: m7rPCXPq
type: code
---

use "game"

with-game {
  render-line "Hello, world!"
}

---
id: wV676HcT
type: text
locked: true
---

The game engine is inspired by [SmileBASIC](http://smilebasic.com/en/e-manual/) and uses the same layout and character set. SmileBASIC contains many special characters to be used as sprites; you can find the list of characters [here](http://smilebasic.com/en/supplements/unicode/). For example, the brick character has code 3:

---
id: s8TYrvmB
type: code
---

use "game"

with-game {
  -- width and height are defined in the game engine
  repeat ((width * height) times) {
    render-glyph 3
  }
}

If you want to fill a line with a character without having to hack your way around `format` or `list`, you can use the `render-fill` and `render-line-fill` functions. And `bg` and `fg` let you control the color of each character:

---
id: HRqlh0KJ
type: code
---

use "game"

with-game {
  bg `#263238`
  fg `#689f38`
  render-line-fill "H H EEE L   L   OOO" 6
  render-line-fill "H H E   L   L   O O" 6
  render-line-fill "HHH EEE L   L   O O" 6
  render-line-fill "H H E   L   L   O O" 6
  render-line-fill "H H EEE LLL LLL OOO" 6
}

Otherwise, everything is up to you! The body of `with-game` is evaluated every frame, so you can use `mutable` at the top level to store any state you might need. [Here](https://wipple.dev/playground/?file=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wipplelang/playground-examples/main/road-rage.txt) is a complex game you can use for inspiration (click "Expand" under the `•••` menu to see the code). The full documentation for the game engine is available [here](https://wipple.dev/doc/game.html). Have fun!
