# How to fix the "uninitialized constant" error

This error occurs when you declare a constant's type but not its value:

---
id: UJ3wdab5
type: code
---

add :: Number -> Number -> Number

---
id: _wa-RLv4
type: text
locked: true
---

To fix the error, provide an implementation:

---
id: Xa6TWcY9
type: code
---

add :: Number -> Number -> Number
add : a b -> a + b

---
id: aU8-1qVH
type: text
locked: true
---

The implementation must immediately follow the type annotation, so the following is invalid:

---
id: DCbV_7pg
type: code
---

f :: Number -> Number
g :: Number -> Number
h :: Number -> Number

f : x -> x + 1
g : x -> x + 2
h : x -> x + 3
