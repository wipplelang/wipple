# Beyond the Playground

Congratulations, you've made it to the end of Learn Wipple! ðŸ¤© Now, you can use the Wipple Playground to create anything you want.

## Making your own lessons

If you click on the six dots on the left-hand side of a code box, you can create a new code box or add some text. Depending on which one you choose, you get different options. For code boxes, you can disable lints for a particular code example if you're trying to explain something and don't want the warnings to get in the way. Text boxes are rendered as [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org), and when you're done editing, make sure to lock the text box so people don't accidentally expose the Markdown while they're trying to read.

To share your lesson, just copy the URL in the address bar, or click Copy Link in the menu next to the beginner mode toggle at the bottom of the screen.

## Add Wipple to your website

Once you're finished creating something in Wipple, you can export it as a website to embed anywhere! Just click the `â€¢â€¢â€¢` icon in the top right of any code editor, and then click **Download Website**.

If you want to add your project to an existing website, you can add the following code to your HTML:

```html
<head>
    ...

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://wipple.dev/embed/style.css" />
</head>

<body>
    ...

    <script type="module" src="https://wipple.dev/embed/index.js"></script>

    <wipple>
        <script type="application/wipple">
            -- Your Wipple code here!
        </script>
    </wipple>
</body>
```

You can add multiple `<wipple>` elements anywhere on the page (including inside other elements) and they will all run. You only need to include the CSS and JavaScript from `wipple.dev` once, though.

## Thank you!
