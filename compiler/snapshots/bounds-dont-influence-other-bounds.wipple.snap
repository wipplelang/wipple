`f` (compiler/tests/bounds-dont-influence-other-bounds.wipple:12:2-12:3) (incomplete-type):

  Missing information for the type of `f` (compiler/tests/bounds-dont-influence-other-bounds.wipple:12:2-12:3).

  Wipple determined this code is `(Number; _)` (compiler/tests/bounds-dont-influence-other-bounds.wipple:12:8-12:17), but it needs some more information for the `_` placeholders.

`_` (compiler/tests/bounds-dont-influence-other-bounds.wipple:12:16-12:17) (unknown-type):

  Could not determine the type of `_` (compiler/tests/bounds-dont-influence-other-bounds.wipple:12:16-12:17).

  Wipple needs to know the type of this code before running it. Try using a function or assigning it to a variable.
