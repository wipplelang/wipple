# How to fix the "instance collides with another instance" error

This error occurs when you have two instances of a trait that could potentially apply to the same types. You can only declare one instance per set of types per trait. For example, `instance (Show Text)` is already declared in the standard library, so you can't override it:

---
id: oazU2lp9
type: code
---

instance (Show Text) : ...

---
id: y8Cugq6c
type: text
locked: true
---

If you have a trait with an [inferred type parameter](https://wipple.dev/playground/?file=https://wipple.dev/std/examples/infer.txt), that type parameter does not factor into the collision check. For example, adding two `Number`s produces a `Number` as defined by the standard library, so you can't add a new instance that produces anything else from two `Number`s:

---
id: wUIX0E1S
type: code
---

My-Number : type

instance (Add Number Number My-Number) : ...

---
id: qJzrlXdx
type: text
locked: true
---

To fix this error, try declaring a new type and defining instances for that type instead:

---
id: wjw3q6D_
type: code
---

My-Number : type {
  n :: Number
}

instance (Add My-Number My-Number My-Number) : a b -> \
  My-Number { n : (n of a) + (n of b) }
