# How to fix the "recursive type" error

This error occurs when the type of a value is found to reference itself, indicating a programming error because such a value cannot be constructed:

---
id: 1l_F6kUe
type: code
lint: false
---

call-with-itself : x -> x x

---
id: cS6zYqr3
type: text
locked: true
---

If `x` has the type `a -> b`, then because it's called with itself, `a` must be the type `a -> b` as well. So the type of `x` is `((((... -> b) -> b) -> b) -> b) -> b` (going on forever).

This error occurs very rarely; if you encounter it, try adding manual type annotations to your code until you find the issue.
