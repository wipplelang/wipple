Feedback:

`x :: String` (test/tests/mismatched-inferred-params.wipple:3:25-3:36) (conflicting-types):

  `x :: String` (test/tests/mismatched-inferred-params.wipple:3:25-3:36) is a `Number` (test/tests/mismatched-inferred-params.wipple:3:2-3:3) or a `String` (test/tests/mismatched-inferred-params.wipple:3:30-3:36), but it can only be one of these.

  `x :: String` (test/tests/mismatched-inferred-params.wipple:3:25-3:36) must be the same type as `x` (test/tests/mismatched-inferred-params.wipple:3:25-3:26), `1` (test/tests/mismatched-inferred-params.wipple:3:2-3:3), `2` (test/tests/mismatched-inferred-params.wipple:3:5-3:6), and 69 others; double-check these.

  -  `1` (test/tests/mismatched-inferred-params.wipple:3:2-3:3) is a Number.

  -  `2` (test/tests/mismatched-inferred-params.wipple:3:5-3:6) is a Number.

  -  `3` (test/tests/mismatched-inferred-params.wipple:3:8-3:9) is a Number.

  -  `element` (library/src/foundation/sequence.wipple:196:29-196:36) must have the same type everywhere in this use of `instance (As-Sequence (List element) element)` (library/src/foundation/sequence.wipple:196:1-208:2).

  -  `input` (library/src/foundation/sequence.wipple:66:15-66:20) must have the same type everywhere in this use of `transform` (library/src/foundation/sequence.wipple:66:1-66:99).

  -  `output` (library/src/foundation/sequence.wipple:66:24-66:30) must have the same type everywhere in this use of `transform` (library/src/foundation/sequence.wipple:66:1-66:99).
