Introducing a new code editor for the Wipple Playground!

![New code editor](/blog/2024-09-15/images/new-code-editor.png)

The new editor features a **sidebar** with a **Run button** and an improved **command palette**. It also has **all-new error messages**, redesigned to be less overwhelming and more helpful.

### Run button

Instead of compiling and running code automatically, the new editor has a Run button that students click when they're ready. As a result, editing code is less distracting, because you can finish typing before errors pop up.

### Command palette

The new command palette is displayed permanently in the sidebar, instead of hidden in a dropdown. Commands are categorized, with an option to view all commands as well. Dragging a command into the editor now shows a full preview of the code that will be added, so you know exactly what will change.

### Redesigned error messages

Wipple's new error messages are more friendly, appear one at a time, and include guiding questions to help students fix them on their own.

Not all errors have guiding questions yet — as part of my research at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu), I will be improving the messages of and adding guiding questions to almost every error. I will also use the responses to the guiding questions to determine how students are learning!

### Print button

Finally, the `•••` menu contains a new Print button, so students can export their work as a PDF and take a printed copy home with them!

### Conclusion

The new code editor is live at [wipple.org](https://www.wipple.org). Click **Start coding now** to open the playground. I'm excited to continue refining the design in response to student feedback!
