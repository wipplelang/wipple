Feedback:

`T : value => trait ()` (test/tests/colliding-instances.wipple:1:1-3:22) (conflicting-instances):

  `T : value => trait ()` (test/tests/colliding-instances.wipple:1:1-3:22) has multiple overlapping instances: `instance (T X)` (test/tests/colliding-instances.wipple:6:1-6:20), `instance (T X)` (test/tests/colliding-instances.wipple:7:1-7:20), `instance (T value)` (test/tests/colliding-instances.wipple:9:1-9:24), and 1 other.

  Only one of these instances can be defined at a time. Try making your instance more specific.
