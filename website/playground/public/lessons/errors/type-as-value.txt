# How to fix the "cannot use type as value" error

This error occurs when you attempt to use a type as a value without instantiating it. In Wipple, types are only used to ensure your code is valid and do not exist when the program runs:

---
id: ONHMrQpb
type: code
lint: true
---

Person : type { name :: Text }
instance (Show Person) : { name } -> name

show Person

---
id: jWjBBqt9
type: text
locked: true
---

To fix the error, try providing a value of the type instead:

---
id: dGMC73IB
type: code
---

Person : type { name :: Text }
instance (Show Person) : { name } -> name

show (Person { name : "Alice" })
