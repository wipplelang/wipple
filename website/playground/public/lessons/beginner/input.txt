# User input

So far, we've written programs that always do the same thing. Now, we'll learn how to make our programs interactive by getting input from the user!

Let's start by creating a text field that the user can type into. We can do this using the `prompt` command:

---
id: 30DAFG7v
type: code
---

name : prompt "What is your name?"
show (format "Hello, _!" name)

---
id: kRisjDRb
type: text
locked: true
---

Try typing your name into the text field and watch the program greet you!

In addition to prompting for text, you can prompt for numbers! Wipple has an advanced algorithm that determines what kind of input you want; in the following example, it knows that you want a number because of the `n + 1`. Try entering something that's not a number — you'll see the Playground highlights the text field in red, indicating an error.

type: code
---

n : prompt "Enter a number"
show (format "The next number after _ is _" n (n + 1))

---
id: c-u5gYPi
type: text
locked: true
---

Wipple also has another command called `choice` that allows the user to pick from a set of options:

---
id: uEm0HRas
type: code
---

colors : list "red" "orange" "yellow" "green" "blue" "violet"
color : choice "Favorite color" colors
show (format "Your favorite color is _" color)

---
id: oZp9id6Y
type: text
locked: true

In a future lesson, you'll learn how to make decisions based on the user's input using `when` and `if`. For now, though, let's move on to something new!
