# Text

Something that often confuses beginners is the difference between names and text. In Wipple, a **name** represents something known by the computer, where **text** is always put between quotation marks and represents something literally.

For example, when we write `show "Hello!"`, `show` is a name and `"Hello!"` is text:

---
id: eLKLdF_2
type: code
---

show "Hello!"

---
id: Xw3WG0r_
type: text
locked: true
---

Watch what happens if we forget to put the quotes:

---
id: wBK7yj3I
type: code
---

show Hello!

---
id: g4l8og2L
type: text
locked: true
---

Error! Try hovering over the highlighted code and see if you can fix it.

Now, let's learn how to define our own names!
