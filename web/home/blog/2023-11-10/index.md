Inspired by the [reading guides](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/FREE-Reading-Guide-Strips-5873027) students use to focus on one line at a time in a book, Wipple now has a focus mode that highlights the active line and fades away the other lines!

You can enable it in the Wipple Playground settings.
