Feedback:

`repeat` (compiler/tests/repeat-missing-times.wipple:3:1-3:7) (error-instance):

  Missing `times` after   `5` (compiler/tests/repeat-missing-times.wipple:3:8-3:9).

 Try rewriting this code as `(  `5` (compiler/tests/repeat-missing-times.wipple:3:8-3:9) times)`, or double-check your parentheses.
