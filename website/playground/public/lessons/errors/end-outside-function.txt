# How to fix the "cannot use `end` outside a function" error

This error occurs when you use `end` outside a function body. `end` is used to exit from a function early, so it doesn't make sense to use it outside a function:

---
id: i99L0eN7
type: code
---

end "Hello, world!"

---
id: Dm5jG-i0
type: text
locked: true
---

If you want to exit the program early at the top level, use a function like `error` instead:

---
id: fopGOPr6
type: code
---

error "Hello, world!"
