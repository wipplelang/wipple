The Wipple Playground has a brand-new module designed to teach students about climate change. A new lesson titled "Writing efficient code" explores how you can write the same program in different ways to save energy. When you run your code, Wipple analyzes your CPU's power consumption and displays a report showing the cost and emissions of various energy sources used to run your program at scale.

This module is the result of a project I worked on with Demetrios Kennedy at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://wpi.edu). You can view the lesson [here](https://wipple.dev/playground/?lesson=expert/writing-efficient-code), and you can use the energy module as part of your own programs by clicking Energy when you open the playground!
