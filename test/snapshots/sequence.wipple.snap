`_ :: Number` (test/tests/sequence.wipple:26:14-26:25) (conflicting-types):

  `_ :: Number` (test/tests/sequence.wipple:26:14-26:25) is a `String` (test/tests/sequence.wipple:25:17-25:23) or a `Number` (test/tests/sequence.wipple:26:19-26:25), but it can only be one of these.

  `_ :: Number` (test/tests/sequence.wipple:26:14-26:25) must be the same type as `_` (test/tests/sequence.wipple:26:14-26:15), `String` (test/tests/sequence.wipple:25:17-25:23), `Number` (test/tests/sequence.wipple:26:19-26:25), and 17 others; double-check these.

  -  `item` (test/tests/sequence.wipple:22:12-22:16) must have the same type everywhere in this use of `filter` (test/tests/sequence.wipple:22:1-22:95).

  -  `value` (test/tests/sequence.wipple:20:28-20:33) must have the same type everywhere in this use of `instance (As-Sequence (Box value) value)` (test/tests/sequence.wipple:20:1-20:45).
