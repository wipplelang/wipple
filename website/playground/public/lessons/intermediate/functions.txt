# Functions

In Wipple, a **function** is a way to take a piece of code and use it multiple times without having to copy-paste the code over and over again. For example, let's say we wanted to make a program that greets people by their name:

---
id: WxZ0GcYt
type: code
---

alice : "Alice"
alice-greeting : format "Hello, _!" alice
show alice-greeting

bob : "Bob"
bob-greeting : format "Hello, _!" bob
show bob-greeting

charlie : "Charlie"
charlie-greeting : format "Hello, _!" charlie
show charlie-greeting

---
id: QOix0O8A
type: text
locked: true
---

This code is getting a bit repetitive, but it has a pattern — the greeting only differs by the name of the person. That means we can make a function that accepts a name and produces a greeting!

---
id: fcSyJB-_
type: code
---

greet : name -> {
    greeting : format "Hello, _!" name
    show greeting
}

greet "Alice"
greet "Bob"
greet "Charlie"

As you can see, functions are written using an arrow (`->`, a dash followed by a greater-than sign). The input is on the left, and the output is on the right.

Functions can have a single input or multiple inputs. Just list them all before the arrow:

---
id: 5hCPQ-Eu
type: code
---

add : a b -> a + b
sum : add 1 2
show sum

---
id: xDX-JNhj
type: text
locked: true
---

Let's go back to turtle graphics and add some functions. We can make a `draw-square` function whose input is `size`, and now we can draw a square of any size!

---
id: FczH-Iu7
type: code
---

use "turtle"

draw-square : size -> repeat (4 times) {
  forward size
  left (90 degrees)
}

with-turtle {
    speed 2
    draw-square (10 pixels)
    draw-square (20 pixels)
    draw-square (30 pixels)
    draw-square (40 pixels)
    draw-square (50 pixels)
}

Learning how to use functions is one of the most important skills you can have as a programmer. Over time, you'll figure out when it's a good idea to split your code into functions. For now, though, a good rule of thumb is that any time you have multiple pieces of code that do the same thing, you can make your code easier to read and change by using functions instead. The majority of the remaining Learn Wipple lessons are focused on making your code less repetitive by using and composing functions!

Now for something fun... in the next lesson!
