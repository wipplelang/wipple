# How to use `each`

`each` takes in a value like a list, and calls a function for each element:

---
id: IJRizJdX
type: code
---

each show (list 1 2 3)

---
id: 9q1gR5cs
type: text
locked: true
---

Usually, it's easier to read if you use `.` syntax to move the list in front, and then you can pass a function directly:

---
id: 3bQNOBx8
type: code
---

list 1 2 3 . each (n -> show (n * 2))

---
id: Zjd1MpI7
type: text
locked: true
---

You can use `transform` to move the multiplication out of the `show`:

---
id: ztlUZZzI
type: code
---

list 1 2 3 . transform (n -> n * 2) . each show

---
id: f0K2iit9
type: text
locked: true
---

And finally, you can use partial application to eliminate the inline function:

---
id: sdEOKPaB
type: code
---

list 1 2 3 . transform (Multiply 2) . each show
