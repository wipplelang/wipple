# Variables

It can get confusing to write lots of commands inside each other. Instead, we can give names to each step! This concept is called **variables** — just like in math, where you can give the variable $x$ a value (eg. 5), you can make your own variables in Wipple!

---
id: wj1n7nK-
type: code
---

x : 5
show x

---
id: WL_rUS7H
type: text
locked: true
---

In Wipple, you can create variables by using the `:` symbol, where the name of the variable goes on the left and the value goes on the right. After you create the variable, you can use it in place of a number — anywhere the computer sees `x`, it will replace it with `5`!

You can also put more complicated code on the right-hand side:

---
id: KNrqEyXw
type: code
---

sum : 5 + 2
show sum

---
id: 4WaW6Unj
type: text
locked: true
---

Notice that there's no need to limit yourself to a single letter — variable names can be as descriptive as you want! The only restriction is that if you want to have multiple words, you need to separate them with a `-`. That way, a space always represents the end of one command and the beginning of the next command.

my-awesome-variable : 10 / 5
show my-awesome-variable

---
id: rew0Ep44
type: text
locked: true
---

Variables work with more than just numbers — you can use text as well as other variables!

---
id: nVS1WaKk
type: code
---

a : 5
b : 2
sum : a + b

answer : "The answer is..."

show answer
show sum

type: text

## The `format` command

Let's learn one more command, called `format`. It lets you put variables inside text!

To use `format`, you provide some text containing `_` placeholders. The placeholders will be replaced with the variables you provide after the text:

---
id: NSc_duTa
type: code
---

name : "your name here"
greeting : format "Hello, _!" name
show greeting

---
id: 8dD_aCHr
type: text
locked: true
---

Try experimenting with variables in the space below!
