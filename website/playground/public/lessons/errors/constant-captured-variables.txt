# How to fix the "constant cannot capture outside variables" error

This error is raised when you have a constant that captures a variable. Constants may not capture variables because they are lazily evaluated, meaning their value is only initialized when accessed for the first time, which may be when the captured variables are no longer in scope:

---
id: Eybz8UDi
type: code
---

f : {
  n : 42

  f :: () -> Number
  f : () -> n

  f
}

show (f ())

To fix this error, you can lift the variables out of the block and make them constants too:

---
id: 1ipzd85_
type: code
---

n :: Number
n : 42

f :: () -> Number
f : () -> n

show (f ())
