## Logic

Up until now, we've written pretty simple programs that always produce the same output. Now, we'll introduce a way for your code to make decisions about its input!

Let's say you wanted to write a program to grant or deny access based on a password. To do this, we need two things:

-   A way to compare two passwords
-   A way to display `access granted` or `access denied` depending on whether the passwords are the same or not

The first thing — comparison — is done by the `=` and `/=` signs in Wipple. Try it out below!

```wipple
show (1 = 1)
show (2 + 2 = 4)
show (5 /= 6)
show ("abc" = "def")
```

By the way, `True` is what's called a **Boolean value**, which can either be `True` or `False`.

The second thing — making a decision — is done by the `if` function. Just provide a Boolean value and two other values. If the Boolean value is `True`, the first value will be returned, and if it's `False`, the second will be returned.

Now we can write our password checker!

```wipple
password : "abc123"
check : input -> if (input = password) "access granted" "access denied"

show (check "letmein")
show (check "password")
show (check "abc123")
```

(Please don't actually implement a password checker like this! Real password checkers use a much more complicated system to ensure security.)

Here are some other logic symbols you can use:

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>**Symbol**</td>
            <td>**Function**</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>`a = b`</td>
            <td>Is `a` equal to `b`?</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>`a /= b`</td>
            <td>Is `a` not equal to `b`?</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>`a < b`</td>
            <td>Is `a` less than `b`?</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>`a > b`</td>
            <td>Is `a` greater than `b`?</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>`a <= b`</td>
            <td>Is `a` less than or equal to `b`?</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>`a >= b`</td>
            <td>Is `a` greater than or equal to `b`?</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>`a and b`</td>
            <td>Are both `a` and `b` `True`?</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>`a or b`</td>
            <td>Is either `a` or `b` `True`?</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
