# How to use `show`

`show` accepts a value, converts it into text, and displays it on the screen:

---
id: OxEQx7cI
type: code
---

show "Hello, world!"
show (1 + 2)
show True

---
id: V-oCN_28
type: text
locked: true
---

`show` only accepts a single value. If you want to `show` multiple values on one line, you can use `format`:

---
id: WKWpp7Bq
type: code
---

show (format "_ + _ = _" 1 2 (1 + 2))

---
id: RK8KJc3S
type: text
locked: true
---

Under the hood, `show` uses the `Show` trait to convert the provided value into text. You can implement `Show` for your own types, too:

---
id: -tP0pM_D
type: code
---

Person : type {
  name :: Text
  age :: Number
}

instance (Show Person) : { name age } -> format "_ is _ years old" name age

bob : Person {
  name : "Bob"
  age : 30
}

show bob
